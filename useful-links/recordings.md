# Recordings

## Catalog

A catalog listing all the recordings taken along with the useful metadata for each sequence can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tG_S0Sj6oWnIz8YA2clwR5c2GdaI8Gq_TGkwSh27RNA/edit#gid=0).

For redundancy, you can also find the link to the OneDrive folder containing all the rosbags [here](https://indianinstituteofscience-my.sharepoint.com/personal/amoghm_iisc_ac_in/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Famoghm_iisc_ac_in%2FDocuments%2Frosbags).
