# Getting Started With SLAM

## Books

The two textbooks listed below provide excellent introductions to the theoretical foundations needed to dive into the world of Visual SLAM \(and also SLAM in general\):

1. **Probabilistic Robotics** **by Sebsatian Thrun, Dieter Fox, and Wolfram Burgard**
2. **Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision by Richard Hartley and David Zisserman**

While _Probabilistic Robotics_ covers the aspects relating to uncertainty in perception and control, _Multiple View Geometry_ covers the "visual" in Visual SLAM. A good way to start might be to read the first few chapters of both the textbooks, which will grant you a feel for the terminology and the components and sub-problems involved.

In addition to this, there are several tutorials, survey papers, seminal research papers, online courses, and even blog articles and YouTube videos that will help you along the way in the journey.
