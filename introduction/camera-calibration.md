# Camera Calibration

In order to be able to determine the relation between the cameraâ€™s natural units \(pixels\) and the real world units \(for example millimeters\), camera calibration is a necessary step. More crudely speaking, all classical visual SLAM frameworks require that you specify the camera calibration parameters as an input. Having a working knowledge of both the _why_ and the _how_ of camera calibration will prove to be extremely handy.
