# Evaluation Techniques

## Evaluation Tools and Metrics

Evaluation tools \(both online and offline\) offered by the TUM Vision group lets you compare the trajectory generated by SLAM algorithms with the ground truth. They also provide tools to preprocess the datasets for evaluation.

The homepage for the evaluation tools can be found [here](https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/tools#evaluation). It includes the desc. The link to the online evaluation tool has also been included for convenience.

## Obtaining Ground Truth

There are a few approximate methods to obtain the ground truth for any trajectory. These include GPS, wheel encoders, and perhaps even another already existing reliable LIDAR-based localization system. However, for accurate ground truths of the position and orientation, either physical measurement or access to a motion capture \(mocap\) laboratory is needed.

## Mocap Laboratory

The mocap laboratory, which is run by Prof. Ashwini Ratnoo, is located in the Department of Aerospace Engineering. To be able to record the output from the mocap system onto your computer, the recommended setup is ROS Kinetic running on Ubuntu 16.04.
